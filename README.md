# PROGRAMMING PROJECTS FOR PHYSICS
This repo consists a Collection of programs for some physics problems. Most of them are done for the Horizon Club (Physics and Astronomy Club of IIT-Madras)

## Satellite Simulation
This is a simple simulation of a satellite revolving around earth(taken stationary) by using an ODE solving python library.
## Diffraction and Interference using FFT
This is the simulation of the fact that Difraction and Interference patterns can be obtained by Fast Fourier Transformation of the Light Intensity at the sources.
## Colour Magnitude Diagram
This code creates the Color Magnitude Diagram of the 5000 nearest stars to earth.
