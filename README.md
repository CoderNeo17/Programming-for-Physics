# PROGRAMMING PROJECTS FOR PHYSICS
This repo consists a Collection of programs for some physics problems. Most of them are done for the Horizon Club (Physics and Astronomy Club of IIT-Madras)

## [Satellite Simulation](https://github.com/CoderNeo17/Programming-for-Physics/blob/main/SatelliteSimulation.ipynb)
This is a simple simulation of a satellite revolving around earth(taken stationary) by using an ODE solving python library.
## [Diffraction and Interference using FFT](https://github.com/CoderNeo17/Programming-for-Physics/blob/main/fft_Diffraction_Interference.ipynb)
This is the simulation of the fact that Difraction and Interference patterns can be obtained by Fast Fourier Transformation of the Light Intensity at the sources.
## [Colour Magnitude Diagram](https://github.com/CoderNeo17/Programming-for-Physics/blob/main/ColorMagnitudeDiagram.ipynb)
This code creates the Color Magnitude Diagram of the 5000 nearest stars to earth.
